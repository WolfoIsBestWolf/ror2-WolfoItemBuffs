# Item Buffs

Buffs or changes to items I see people or me complain about often. 

Each items changes can be turned off in the config.

Some changes are automatically disabled if the mods they're originally inspired from are enabled.\
(Even tho they deprecated anyways to my knowledge)

Mod needed by everyone.

  <summary>ICBM Projectile compatible list</summary>
  
```
List is automatically made depending on what the game thinks is an explosion.
(So that it can work with modded content better)
Some of these are extremely loose on what counts as an 'Explosion'


Sticky Bomb 		 (Bomb)
Ignition Tank		 (Explosive)
Resonance Disk 		 (Explosive)
War Bonds 			 (Missile)(Additional missiles never target Boss)
Molten Perferator	 (Explosive)(+2 not x3)
Egocentrism 		 (Bomb)
Preon Accumleator 	 (Explosive)
Molotov				 (Explosive, kinda)

Commando Phase Round (*)
Commando Grenades 	 (Bomb)
Engi Grenades 		 (Bomb)
Engi Mines			 (Explosive)
MulT Scrap Launcher	 (Missile)
MulT Canister		 (Explosive)
Articer Bolts		 (Explosive, kinda)
Artificer Nano-Bomb  (Bomb)
Articier Ice Spear 	 (*)
REX Mortars			 (Explosive, kinda/**)
Acrid Spit			 (**)
Captain Taser		 (**)
Captain Airstrikes	 (Explosive)
Hooks of Heresy 	 (Expoosive, kinda)
Void Fiend M2		 (Explosive)
Seeker 3rd Punch	 (Explosive, kinda/**)

A bunch of enemy projectiles.

* (Not considered an explosion, but I think should be included)
**(game thinks it's an explosion. And i'm okay including it.)

Didn't want to overlap too much with Ignition Tank or SS2 Erratic Gadget but it happened.

## Notes / Thoughts

Hunter Harpoon
```
Harpoons changes in Returns are amazing.
Any buff that isn't just porting those changes would seem weird.
Slighty adjusted some numbers to better fit into this game.
```

Aegis
```
Too hard to get it's benefit working.
Slower barrier decay will allow lower amounts of healing to accumulate barrier.
Buffing max Barrier capacity like in Returns would buff Aegis when it's already good, which is uneeded. 

(Decided against removing barrier decay all together. Barrier decays, that is it's thing and should stay)
```

Leeching Seed
  
```
Returns just buffed it to 2(+1), while also nerfing Scythe which, are certainly balance choices.
A common mod buff was/is, add healing on all attacks regardless of proc coeff.

I think just on DoTs is fine, adds it's own niche and you do many DoTs so it heals plenty.
```

Nkuhanas Opinion :
```
Little Disciple gets to have a Proc of 1.0, with better activation, and comparable damage. 
This having 0.2 proc is rude, so boosting that, and the damage a bit.
```

Old War Stealthkit & Berzerkers Pauldron.
 ```
Good effects, hindered by activating rarely.
Doubling the range for both should help.
```


Eulogy Zero, Beads of Fealty, Focused Convergence.
```
They are now, funnier.
```
 



Titanic Knurl gives Armor in RoR1/Returns. Weird that it does not in RoR2.

Defense Nucleus stacking stats instead of construct limit makes stacking cleaner and more noticible.
